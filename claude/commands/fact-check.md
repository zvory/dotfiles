# Fact Check

Review the project and module carefully, and revisit the code assumptions, documentation and comments for fact checking.

Make sure the documentation, comments, README files and any agent files (CLAUDE.md, AGENT.md) are in agreement with the code, which is the source of truth.


Do not create a fact check markdown file. Carefully fix the disagreements in place, and I will review carefully.

Make sure you look at EVERY SINGLE PROVIDED FILE:
- Get a list of files.
- Go through every file and fact check, one by one - don't guess which ones might be useful.
