# Commit current work
Commit current work and push.

## Important
- Prepend GIT_EDITOR=true to all git commands you run, especially the ones looking at diffs, so you can avoid getting blocked as you execute commands
- If you can't get any information from `git diff`, just using your working memory to determine what has changed

## Instructions
Review each file individually to make sure they're related to the work you just did, then write a brief commit message in the following format:

- Short title description (< 80 characters), use the format: [component] short description in lower case
- do not use [retriever] as the component name. 
- 2~3 bullet points (< 80 characters) with a quick description

## Notes
- You should only commit work when instructed. Do not keep committing subsquent work unless explicitly told so
