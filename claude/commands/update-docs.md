Find the Confluence links that are linked in the current code or current documentation / README files:

```
rg 'https://datadoghq.atlassian.net/wiki/'
```

Make sure that you use the Atlassian / Confluence MCP to read those and verify for any inaccuracies.

If there are wrong information, update those pages / spaces accordingly.
The current repository / code can be used to fact check any information for the given document links, since code is the source of truth.


NOTE: there may be different audiences for the Confluence, so they might not be 1:1 the same.
Before adding any information, make sure that children pages wouldn't contain repeated information.



Before updating a page, provide a detailed list of the changes that are going to be applied.
